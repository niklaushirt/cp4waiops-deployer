# 3 Architecture
---------------------------------------------------------------


## 3.1 Basic Architecture

The environement (Kubernetes, Applications, ...) create logs that are being fed into a Log Management Tool (ELK in this case).

1. External Systems generate Alerts and send them into the EventManager (Netcool Operations Insight), which in turn sends them to the CP4WAIOps for Event Grouping.
1. At the same time CP4WAIOps ingests the raw logs coming from the Log Management Tool (ELK) and looks for anomalies in the stream based on the trained model.
1. If it finds an anomaly it forwards it to the Event Grouping as well.
1. Out of this, CP4WAIOps creates an Incident that is being enriched with Topology (Localization and Blast Radius) and with Similar Incidents that might help correct the problem.
1. The Incident is then sent to Slack.
1. A Runbook is available to correct the problem but not launched automatically.

## Optimized Demo Architecture

For the this specific Demo environment:

* ELK is not needed as I am using pre-canned logs for training and for the anomaly detection (inception)
* The Events are also created from pre-canned content that is injected into CP4WAIOps
* There are also pre-canned ServiceNow Incidents if you don’t want to do the live integration with SNOW
* The Webpages that are reachable from the Events are static and hosted on my GitHub
* The same goes for ServiceNow Incident pages if you don’t integrate with live SNOW

This allows us to:

* Install the whole Demo Environment in a self-contained OCP Cluster
* Trigger the Anomalies reliably
* Get Events from sources that would normally not be available (Instana, Turbonomic, Metrics Manager, ...)
* Show some examples of SNOW integration without a live system
